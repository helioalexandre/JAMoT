This plugin allows you to read an XML file output by the plugin Cell Counter.

It needs an image to take the width and height dimenions for a new image (ideally the image where the points were created from). It allows you to select which points to draw and in which color.

Just download the .JAR file to the ImageJ plugins folder and go to Plugins>Analyze>Cell Counter>Cell Counter Utility.
